# Output_Number 0
#   "Output_Number" is the name of the output directory number.
# Load 100
#   "Load" is the force exerted on the membrane.
# Pro_Poly 1.0
#   "Pro_Poly" is a parameter tuning actin polymerization rate.
# Actin_Friction 1
#   "Actin_Friction" is the friction coefficient of the single actin particle.
# Wall_Friction 100
#   "Wall_Friction" is the friction coefficient of the wall.
# Rand_Seed 614
#   "Rand_Seed" is the seed of random generator.
# Rand_Seed_Switch 1
#   0=off 1=on
#   if Rand_Seed_Switch is 1, "Rand_Seed" will be changed as "Rand_Seed + Output_Number" when "Output_Number" is renewed.
# Start_Step 0
#   "Start_Step" is the start step.
# End_Step 104001
#   "End_Step" is the end step.
# Restart_Switch 0
#   0=off 1=on
#   If Restart_Switch is 1, the restart file is loaded.
# Restart_Step 4000
#   The restart file is specified by "Restart_Step". Restart files are outputed such as 4000, 14000, 24000, 34000 steps and so on.

# To run V-ActinBD, type the following command under default parallel settings
#mpirun -np 2 ./V-ActinBD.out
#
# If you can use more than 2 processes, you can specify how to divide the space of the caliculated system as follows:
# NX 4
# NY 2
# NZ 2
# mpirun -np 16 ./V-ActinBD.out
# here, for example, the number of processes = 16.
